# Variables description
## trainData: the colum combination of train.subject, train.y and train.x.

## testData: the colum combination of test.subject, test.y and test.x.

## fullData: the row combination of trainData and testData.

## featureIndex: the mean and standard deviation in all the variables.

## finalData: Extracted mean and standard deviation of all measurements.

## groupData: the fina outcome which is a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#  This project is performed under the following instruction:
### 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
### 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
### 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
### 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
